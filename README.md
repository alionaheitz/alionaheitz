# Hi, I'm Aliona!

üèµ**Junior** at Stevens Institute of Technology  
üèµ**Industrial and Systems Engineering** major, with a minor in Computer Engineering 

From data analysis, passing to system design requirements, machine learning, and operation research to embedded systems engineering, I am learning interdisciplinary skills that help me become a well-rounded engineer. I aspire to solve real-world engineering problems with machine learning while meeting big-picture needs.
